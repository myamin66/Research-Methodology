The contents of a Research process are:
  Identify the general research area
  Choose your research topic and domain
  Review the literature
  Identify the research problem
  Formulate the research methodology
  Collect data
  Perform experiments
  Analyze and interpret the data
  Present your findings
  
Research Definition:
  it is a systematic process to find and a systematic process to solve a particular problem
Significance/ Value of Research:
 -  for an undesireable situation
 -  for knowledge seeking
 Research paper: 
 1) primary (technical)
 2) secondary (review)
 
 In conference paper : conference or proceedings keyword
 In Journal: journal keyword or nothing
A paper can be published in only one journal or confernece but that journal can be indexed on multiple academic databases.

Impact factor: no of citation / paper published in that year.
ISI Indexed Journal: if a paper is published in a journal that is available in master journal list and jouranl citation report then this jouranl is called imapct factor or isi indexed journal (Instituter of scientific information).

Classification of research: based on four things  
1) purpose
  a) exploratory
  b) descriptive
  c) explanatory
2) use
  a) basic
  b) applied
3) time
  a) cross-sectional (once)
  b) longitudenal(multiple)
4) data collection
  a) qualitative
  2) quantitative
For exploratory reseach we can do 
1) experience surverys, 2) secondary data analysis, 3) case study, 4) pilot study

RM in CS
1) Implementation driven approach
2) Mathematic proof techniques
3) quantitaive
4) qualitative
5) mixed(qualitative and quantitative)

Why reference management software:
  1) easy to manange and use 
  2) user friendly
  3) auto-references and citation
  5) organize, store, retrieved
  6) duplicate removes
  
  
 To a Systematic Literature review critically
 1) title  : relevent , concise, precise, review keyword
 2) abstrat: background, need, objective, methodogly, results, significance
 3) introduction: rationale (background, need) , objective
 4) methodology: search strategy, keyword, query, search in topic or title, databases, why these dbs, research question, seletion(inclusino and exclusion) criteria, quality assesment criteria, data extraction strategy
 5) review: summarize, critically appraise, futrure direction, (discussion optional)
 6) discussion (optional)
 7) conclusion: summarzise, future directions
 
 authors have done a very good job but in absract lacks significance
 
 Some strength: 1) title 
 2) well defined methodology
 3) apporoach
 4) funnel structure
 
 weaknesses
 1) no future directions, mismatches
 Publicaiton bias: 1) why not grey literature
 2) why only these dbs
 3) why english
 4) why these years
 5) why not conference papers
 5) only good things not limitation to your paper told
